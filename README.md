# Noodle Search Prototypes
Written with React & Webpack, using es2015 & babel.

## Pre-requisites
- You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine to clone the repo
- You will need [nodejs & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install the dependencies and run the build/server scripts

## Installation & Setup
All commands should be run from the root of the project (where the `package.json` file resides).

Installation:
```
npm install
```
This will grab the dependencies (libraries, tools, etc.) from npm and install them in the root directory in `node_modules` (ignored by git).

Build files & run dev server:
```
npm start
```

The dev server is now running and you can see the app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
